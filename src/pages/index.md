# 🪧 Introduction 
Using the power of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [I](https://github.com/DavidJoacaRo), and with the huge help from [Nadwey](https://github.com/Nadwey), a new wiki has been finally rebuilt :D.
Now people with more knowledge can fix any mistakes, or add new content if they want to, it's open-source anyway.

## 📓 Getting Started
If you want to get started in modding Budget Backrooms, see **[Documentation/Before Contributing](/docs)** for more details, after you're done, you can get started in Modding the game by going to **[Documentation/Modding](/docs/modding)**.

If you just want to know more about the game, you can get started by going to the **[Wiki](/wiki)** and finding out more using the sidebar.

### ❔ FAQ
> Why not use Fandom? 

* Well how should I tell it to you, but Fandom is bloated with ads, unless you want to use an [AdBlocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking) which some people don't, or can't use, especially on mobile. *(Solutions like AdAway, or uBlock Origin for Firefox on Android could work, but some people just don't want the hassle)*
    * Also a lot of distractions that will get you off-track with the current wiki that you're looking at.
    * It would be complicated to learn the Fandom-type of syntax and to customize it here and there, it just takes more time.

> I'm having issues with my project, what do I do?
* Again, the Documentation is NOT foolproof, which means you have to double-check if it's an issue on your end, if not, it's a project issue and it's recommended to post an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/DavidJoacaRo/Budget-Backrooms), and we could troubleshoot the issue, with your cooperation of course; __More details = better chance to figure out the issue__.
* If GitHub's not the thing for you, an alternate solution is that you can join [Budget Backrooms on Discord](https://discord.gg/WVuTB56ag4), and make a ticket, OR explain your problem as detailed as possible in `#dev-talk`.
