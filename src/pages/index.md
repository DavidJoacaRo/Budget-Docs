## ❔ FAQ
> Why not use Fandom?

* Well how should I tell it to you, but Fandom is bloated with ads, unless you use an [AdBlocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blocking) which some people don't, or can't use, especially on mobile. *(Solutions like AdAway, or uBlock Origin for Firefox on Android could work, but some people just don't want the hassle)*
    * Also a lot of distractions that will literally get you off-track with the current wiki that you're looking at.
        * For example, if you scroll all the way down, you're still getting to see articles from other Wikis, it's just inconvienent
* It would be complicated to learn the Fandom-type of syntax, and to customization there and there, it just takes more time.
