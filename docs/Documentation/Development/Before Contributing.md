# üìù Pull Request Bare Minimum

## What's this?

Well let's say this is a quick guide on how to get accepted when making contributions to this game.

## What do I need?

Well, to be honest with you. I accept everything that goes on with the game. UI, Features, Gamemodes, Maps.

* UI's bare acceptance minimum
    * If using icons, they should be the [Material Icons using Two-Tone Style](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Two+tone&icon.set=Material+Icons) on white.
    * Text should use Rubik font, make it so it looks good on both small and big screens (even though im incapable to do so).
    * Other, that means blur, transparency, boxes, dialogues or other screens
        * Please at least inspire from existing widgets and try to copy their style.

* Features
    * Make sure the features fit to the game.
        * When adding funny things, make them game changer, use your brain more than mine.
    

* AI
    * It should be good enough, and have a good mechanism.
        * I don't know how to do good AI too so my bad why am I writing this :(

* Gamemodes & Maps

    * Gamemodes
        * Existing Gamemode contributions (ex: working on unavailable or existing gamemdes.)
            * Should be what the Gamemode's title inquires.
            * Improvements and modifications should be explained in the Pull Request's description.
    
        * New Gamemode?
            * It should fit to the game, (e.g. Practice Mode, Multiplayer, Split-Screen, Catch the Flashlight), you know.. something.
    
    * Maps

        * Should use the same "realistic but not so" style like the other levels. A puzzle or mechanism is optional, please also provide infos.
            * FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT INSTALL 16 ASSET PACKS ONLY FOR ONE FUCKING MAP, GITHUB IS JUST GONNA SUSPEND MY WHOLE REPOSITORY
                * Do NOT make zip bombs out of this game.


## üîß Notice about Game Mods or Modpacks

This is if you want to do your own set of modifications, without touching or wanting to contribute to this repository.

The name of Modpacks for this game usually refers to do your own set of custom maps and stuff from your existent knowledge, and modify the game to your liking. Have fun because I'm not sure I can give support so mark them as unofficial please :)

Before that,

**It's recommended to:**
* Clone the repository locally, good luck uploading it because Git LFS rejects me.

* Do your own stuff, it's your modpack anyways.

* Credit the sound/texture/model authors properly.
    * Funny joke I forgot to credit them in my own game ;-;
