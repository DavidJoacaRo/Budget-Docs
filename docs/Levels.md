> ⚠️ This page requires a major rewrite since the level order are confirmed to be changed by the 0.0.11 Alpha update. Updating this page might take some time and/or be late.


Self-explanatory. This *section* will help you through the Levels. Here you'll find each level's mechanic, possible exit, and entity occurence.

## Entity occurrences

The spreadsheet below will show you which entity is in which level (which I bet it will ruin the whole fun, but if you are a bug hunter or some, fine go ahead)

| Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 2 Howlers | [Nothing] | Smiler |

And here are the sub-levels.

| Level "Before This Game Existed" | Level "You Cheated" | Level "!" |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| [Nothing] | [Nothing] | Smiler |

The wiki will get updated whenever I have time and when a new update comes out, or perhaps throughout development.

## Level Mechanics

Each level is designed momentarily linear, but encouraging the player to explore instead of playing for the objective: (get the hell out of the level).

Technically you can speedrun the levels.

ℹ️ Things to keep in mind:
* Levels are not procedurally generated because I am incapable of doing so.
* All of the levels are made using Unreal's [Geometry Brush Actors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Actors/Brushes/) (or how I like to call them, BSP Brushes). So, optimization is thrown out of the window (bad).
* I am not that good at Level Design, I barely have ideas.
* Everything in this game uses [dynamic lighting](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/BuildingWorlds/LightingAndShadows/), so performance is a bit of a issue to fix for me. If you have a good GPU, the game will run pretty smooth.

# Levels

There are currently 7-8 Levels in Budget Backrooms.
* Level 0
* Level 1
* Level 2+3 (Lazy to do Level 3, because the mechanic was already in Lv.2)
* Level 4
* * Level "Before This Game Existed"
* * Level "You Cheated"
* * Level "!" ("Run for your Life")

## Level 0 | "The Lobby"
<div style={"float:right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px"}>

> *"Level 0 is an expansive non-Euclidean space, resembling the back rooms of a retail outlet. All rooms in Level 0 share the same superficial features, such as worn mono-yellow wallpaper, old moist carpet, scattered electrical outlets, and inconsistently-placed fluorescent lighting. Aside from these common features, no two rooms within the level are identical.
The fluorescent lighting present in Level 0 hums at a constant frequency. This buzzing is notably louder and more obtrusive than ordinary fluorescent lights, and examination of the fixtures to determine the source has been inconclusive thus far. Secondly, the substance lightly saturating the carpet cannot be consistently identified; it is not water, nor is it safe to consume." [¹]*

**Level 0**, and by extension, the Backrooms, can be accessed by accidentally noclipping out-of-bounds in normal reality. In addition, many levels can lead one to **Level 0** [¹].

In order to escape **Level 0** you need to explore and find the exit. It usually looks like a white glowing doorstep. Be careful of [The Howler(s)](https://github.com/DavidJoacaRo/Budget-Backrooms/wiki/Entities#the-howler), they usually roam the exit and the entrance area.

## Level 1 | "Habitable Zone"
<div style={"float:right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px"}>
 <img align="right" width="275" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32200281/220982968-731a7185-26de-4ae1-b573-0a804e162d97.png"/>
</div>

**Level 1** is a big warehouse facility, with construction equipment left in the area. The place is usually very dark, because of the poorly lit lights. There are no known records of Entities in the area at the moment.

An known emergency exit has been found at 2nd Floor leading to **Level 2**.

## Level 2 | "Pipe Dreams"
<div style={"float:right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px"}>
 <img align="right" width="275" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32200281/220988690-0334e821-6967-4c94-8ec3-a6d70615e06e.jpg"/>
</div>

**Level 2** is a hallway, surrounded by a lot of concrete, construction leftovers, and flickering lights. The zone has a good lighting environment.

There is a dark corner that a [Smiler](https://github.com/DavidJoacaRo/Budget-Backrooms/wiki/Entities#the-smiler) stays there, watching every step. Be careful and keep your flashlight off, they hate bright light.

## Level 4 | "Abandoned Office"

**To be continued, will be available when 0.0.11 Alpha launches :)**
