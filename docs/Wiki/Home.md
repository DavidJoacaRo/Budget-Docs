## ❔ Why
This wiki has been made for everyone. Since the player base is tiny, I bet no one was planning to create a wiki. So I felt generous enough to write one since no one else was going to. The wiki is designed for those who want to learn more about the game's behind-the-scenes mechanics and details without having to download the game's source code, just like any other wiki.
