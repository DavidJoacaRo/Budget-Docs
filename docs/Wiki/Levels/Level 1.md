**Level 1** is a big warehouse facility, with construction equipment left in the area. The place is usually very dark, because of the poorly lit lights. There are no known records of Entities in the area at the moment, hence its name "Habitable Zone"

The warehouse is a mess of pallets of boxes, forklifts, and construction vehicles, some covered in dust, others appearing recently used. Scattered remnants add to the unsettling ambiance.


## Origin
The level is also known as the "parking zone" in other variations of the backrooms fandoms <a href="https://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1">*(example here)*</a>. In these other variations there are even gardens!



## In-Game
In *Level 1* you can gain *2* potential achievements.

There have been reports of deaths for those who attempt to fall directly in the middle of the staircase or trying to get near the *Almond Pessi* vending machine.

A known emergency exit has been found on the 1st Floor leading to a spiral staircase leading into [Level 2](/wiki/levels/2).
