**Level 3** consists of a mix between [Level 2](/wiki/levels/2) and [Level 1](/wiki/levels/1). There are remains of pipes and building equipment from previous levels, apparently this level was supposed to be expanded.


## In-Game
It's an Electrical Station, having a faulty power box that requires a restart upon entering. There are three main walkways to go down, two of which being useless. One of the "useless" walkways contains the faulty power box, even if it isnt required. However unless you have played through it before its smart to just turn it on.

Exiting requires that you get past the smilers, the power box is optional to restart unless you know the level's layout by hand.
At the exit hallway, you can either choose to proceed to [**Level 1 Annex 2**](/wiki/levels/1a2) or risk yourself to **The Fog**.
