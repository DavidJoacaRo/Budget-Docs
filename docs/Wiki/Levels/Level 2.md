**Level 2** is a long hallway, surrounded by pipes and the sounds of water flowing through. The small lights under the pipes give you an idea of where to go, but it looks self-explanatory anyway.

There have been the first-time occurrences of [Smilers](/wiki/entities#the-smiler). An exit can be found after dealing with them which leads to [Level 3](/wiki/levels/3).
