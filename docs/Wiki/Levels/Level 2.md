**Level 2** is a long hallway, surrounded by pipes and the sounds of water flowing through. The small lights under the pipes give you an idea of where to go, but it looks self-explanatory anyway.

Despite the name "*Pipe Dreams*", originally, this level  in other fandoms is known as "*abandoned utility halls*

Although the level isnt exactly straightforward, its not a massive area neither and casually walking will have you in level 3 eventually, even if you havent a clue where to go.

There have been the first-time occurrences of [Smilers](/wiki/entities#the-smiler). An exit can be found after dealing with them which leads to [Level 3](/wiki/levels/3).
