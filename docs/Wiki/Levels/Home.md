# About this section

</div>
Self-explanatory. This section will help you through the levels. Here you'll find each level's mechanic, possible exit, and entity occurrences.

## Level Mechanics

Each level is designed momentarily linear but encourages the player to explore instead of playing for the objective: (get the hell out of the level).

The levels / game is technically "speedrunnable", there are no form of rewards for doing so, however there is a small community for speedrunning on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/Budget_Backrooms?h=any&x=ndxq9yrk)

:::info[Things to keep in mind]

* Levels are not procedurally generated because I am incapable of doing so.

* All of the levels are made using Unreal's [Geometry Brush Actors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Actors/Brushes/) (or as I like to call them, BSP Brushes). So, optimization is thrown out of the window (bad).

* I am not that good at Level Design, I barely have ideas.

* Everything in this game uses [dynamic lighting](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/BuildingWorlds/LightingAndShadows/), so performance is a bit of an issue to fix for me. If you have a good GPU, the game will run pretty smooth.
    * Speaking of performance, baked lighting takes ages to compile, and the lightmaps are fricking broken.
