Self-explanatory. This *section* will help you through the Levels. Here you'll find each level's mechanic, possible exit, and entity occurrences.

## Level Mechanics

Each level is designed momentarily linear but encourages the player to explore instead of playing for the objective: (get the hell out of the level).

Technically you can speedrun the levels.

:::info[Things to keep in mind]
* Levels are not procedurally generated because I am incapable of doing so.
* All of the levels are made using Unreal's [Geometry Brush Actors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Actors/Brushes/) (or as I like to call them, BSP Brushes). So, optimization is thrown out of the window (bad).
* I am not that good at Level Design, I barely have ideas.
* Everything in this game uses [dynamic lighting](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/BuildingWorlds/LightingAndShadows/), so performance is a bit of an issue to fix for me. If you have a good GPU, the game will run pretty smooth.
    * Speaking of performance, baked lighting takes ages to compile, and the lightmaps are fricking broken.
