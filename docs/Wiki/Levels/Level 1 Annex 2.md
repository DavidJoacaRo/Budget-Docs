**Annex 2** is an extension of [Level 1](/wiki/levels/1), it has the same features as the main level, and features a widely fenced out area with some portapottys and some leftover construction props.

While it is noted as an "extension", the level itself is a separate area and has no direct connection to the main level. The area is also known for being a "safe zone" as there are no known entities in the area, despite the occasional lights outage.

## Origin
> *Custom take on an alternate Level 1. It's still left to be expanded.*

## In-Game
Going down the slope where the text "ANNEX 2" is leads you to the floor below, which is a fenced out area with some portapottys and leftover props, following the path ahead leads you to a near-center area of the floor, where you can also spot the exit which will lead you to [Level 4](/wiki/levels/4).
