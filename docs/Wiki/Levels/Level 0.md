> *"Level 0 is an expansive non-Euclidean space, resembling the back rooms of a retail outlet. All rooms in Level 0 share the same superficial features, such as worn mono-yellow wallpaper, old moist carpet, scattered electrical outlets, and inconsistently-placed fluorescent lighting. Aside from these common features, no two rooms within the level are identical.
The fluorescent lighting present in Level 0 hums at a constant frequency. This buzzing is notably louder and more obtrusive than ordinary fluorescent lights, and examination of the fixtures to determine the source has been inconclusive thus far. Secondly, the substance lightly saturating the carpet cannot be consistently identified; it is not water, nor is it safe to consume." [ยน]*

**Level 0**, and by extension, the Backrooms, can be accessed by accidentally no-clipping out-of-bounds in normal reality. In addition, many levels can lead one to **Level 0** [ยน].

In order to escape **Level 0** you need to explore the vast area of Level 0. Be careful of [The Howler(s)](/wiki/entities#the-howler), they usually roam the exit and the entrance area. The exit usually looks like a ladder leading to [Level 1](/wiki/levels/1)
