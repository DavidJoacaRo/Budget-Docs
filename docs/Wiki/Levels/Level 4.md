**Level 4** is a small office room area, decorated with a teal-white color scheme. While the weather outside appears to be very rainy, inside it has been reported to be comfortably warm. Desks are scattered around but in an organized manner. The building does receive electricity and there are computers that can be minimally interacted with. Not many documents can be found and some chairs appear to be turned over.


## *Origin*
> *Level 4 resembles an empty office building, though it is almost completely devoid of furniture. Some rooms on this level have windows, though most of them have been completely blacked out. Any windows that have not been blacked out are considered traps, and should be avoided at all costs. [ยน]*

## In-Game
One has to go out the small-hallway and follow ahead to get to the next level, which is [Level 5](/wiki/levels/5). There are no known entities in this level, however there have been reports of hearing banging on the windows.
